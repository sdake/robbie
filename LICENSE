1. PRELUDE

1.1 HOW TO USE THIS TEXT ON YOUR OWN WORK.

    If you wish to apply these terms to your own work, even by reference, YOU
    must first enter into the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT, which gives
    permission to use this copyrighted text.

1.2 COPYRIGHT OF THIS TEXT

    Copyright (C) 2024 POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION. All rights reserved.

    These sections do not originate with us and we do not claim copyright
    upon them:
    * The section on ARBITRATION originates with the American Arbitration
      Association.
    * The definition of COMPILATION (MEANING 2) comes from Title 17 of the
      United States Code, Section 101.
    * The section on FORCE MAJEURE comes from a list of examples at
      https://afterpattern.com/clauses/force-majeure , but we don't have any
      other information regarding its origin.

1.3 TEXTUAL STYLE, ADVISORY SECTIONS AND WORKING NOTES

    Text contained within square brackets ("[" and "]") is advisory in
    nature and not part of these terms. These terms will not be invalidated
    or otherwise impaired if advisory sections are incorrect or become
    out-of-date. [This is an example of an advisory section.]

    Text contained within angle brackets ("<" and ">") is a working note, and
    is not intended to be present within a FINAL version of these terms. Working
    notes are of relevance to the terms authors only, and will have no effect.
    <This is an example of a working note.>

1.5 THE CONTACT.txt FILE

    The identity of the LICENSORS and the means of contacting them should
    appear in the file "CONTACT.txt" where the SOURCE CODE is stored. This
    file may also contain caveats regarding the work, declarations of
    PUBLIC INTERFACES, statements regarding the source and status of
    some portions of the work (for example that the developer disclaims
    copyright to that portion), and other information that may effect
    your rights.

1.6 DRAFT NATURE OF THIS DOCUMENT

    This is a DRAFT version of the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST LICENSE.
    [If you don't like these terms, contact the LICENSORS for a different
    license.]

    WARNING: These terms are not the product of an attorney, and that's a
    particularly bad practice - the way a judge would enforce (or decline to
    enforce) these terms is unpredictable, and they may let down the developer
    who attempts to enforce them in court. Apply these terms to your work at
    your own risk. [We intend to release a version that is the product of a
    competent attorney.]

1.7 POST-OPEN ISN'T OPEN SOURCE
    The POST-OPEN ZERO-COST LICENSE does not comply with the Open Source
    Definition, thus Post-Open is not Open Source.

    Post-Open is a successor paradigm informed by the history of Open Source
    and created by the author of the Open Source Definition.

2.  DEFINITIONS

    This section contains definitions of terms in this document.

    References to defined terms are rendered in all-capital lettering, for
    example: "TERMINATION". When a defined term appears in lower-case, it
    refers to the general usage of that word rather than the defined form,
    for example "WORK" refers specifically to the work placed under these
    terms by the LICENSORS, and a "work" may be the WORK or another one.
    Section headings are also rendered all-capitals, and some words in these
    terms appear as all-capital simply as part of common parlance, for
    example "A" and "HTTP".

    For terms that are not defined in this section, there is an authorative
    external legal dictionary. See the definition of US-ENGLISH.

2.1 The POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION is the entity which, through the POST-OPEN
    OPERATING AGREEMENT with all of the LICENSORS of works in the
    POST-OPEN COLLECTION, may represent itself and any of those
    LICENSORS in any controversy or claim arising out of or related to
    these terms and its other agreements and processes. As part of its
    normal operations, the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may join with YOU
    into a POST-OPEN PERMISSION on behalf of itself and all LICENSEES
    of works in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION. The POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION
    may bring suit or enforce other law on behalf of the all LICENSORS
    of works in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION.

2.2 The POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT is these same terms, with the addition
    of clear and recorded consent by YOU. [To enter into it, see
    https://postopen.org/zero-contract/ ]

2.3 The POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT is a separate agreement which grants additional
    rights not provided by these terms. [To enter into it, see
    https://postopen.org/paid-contract/ ]

2.4 The POST-OPEN REMEDIATION PROCESS is the process by which an infringing
    entity cures an infringement and comes back into compliance without
    litigation.  Uncooperative infringers are, of course, subject to
    litigation, blocking of imports, simple and punitive damages, and
    other prosecution. [To participate in the POST-OPEN REMEDIATION
    PROCESS, see https::/postopen.org/remediation/ ]

2.5 YOU are:
    a) The entity exercising RESTRICTED RIGHTS under these terms.
    b) An entity with power of attorney or legal responsibility for the
       entity of subsection a, when the entity of subsection a does
       not have contractual capacity or when their civil rights have
       been abridged.
       [Contractual capacity is the legal ability to enter into a binding
        contract. The entity of subsection a might be a legal minor,
        a mentally ill or mentally disabled person, or an incarcerated
        person. The entity of subsection b might be a parent or guardian,
        a family member or other person who the party of subsection a has
        granted a written power of attorney, a court-ordered conservator,
        a lawyer, or a correctional official.]
    c) Any other entity, when the entity of subsection a or b exercises
       RESTRICTED RIGHTS on their behalf, directly or through other entities.
    d) Any other entity in which the entity of subsection a, b, or c exercises
       significant control or ownership, directly or through other entities,
       and receives benefit from those entities exercise of RESTRICTED RIGHTS.
    e) Any other entity which exercises significant control or ownership
       of the entity of subsection a, b or c directly or through other entities,
       and receives benefit from those entities exercise of RESTRICTED RIGHTS.
       This includes (but is not limited to) the national branch of a local
       entity.
    [This is meant to pierce the corporate veil, where allowable, and
     to properly classify that many small local entities of a deep-pockets
     worldwide organization belong under the POST-OPEN PAID LICENSE as an
     aggregate.]

    Where the above definition contains multiple legal entities, all are
    subject to these terms, including the sections regarding TERMINATION.
    This is to avoid the situation in which a company or companies create
    a legal entity specifically for the purpose of entering into these
    terms while insulating other parts of the company, or some asset,
    from their effect. [One example is an entity that we believe Qualcom
     created to make contributions to Open Source without exposing their
     patents to terms in the GPL and other Open Source licenses.]

    YOUR is the possessive or adjective form of YOU. YOURS is the second-person
    possessive pronoun form of YOU.

2.6 A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL is a computational program or device that makes
    use of data to influence its future logical operations, with or without
    inclusion of that data textually or in any recognizable form. Other names
    for MACHINE LEARNING MODEL are artificial intelligence (abbreviated AI),
    and large language model.

2.7 To TRAIN is to input data for the purpose of producing or improving a
    MACHINE LEARNING MODEL. TRAINED is the past tense of TRAIN.

2.8 AGGREGATION is the storage of multiple works on a storage medium for the
    purpose of permitting access to the individual works for the purpose of
    transferring them to another medium, for example computer memory or
    another storage medium; or the provision of those works via a method
    of access, for example a web site, for the purpose of transferring
    the individual works to another medium. Provision of a COMPILATION
    (MEANING 2) including the WORK for REMUNERATION is not AGGREGATION.

2.9 The WORK is the computer program, data, or other information to which
    these terms are applied by the LICENSORS, any derivative of the WORK
    under copyright or moral rights law, any MODIFICATION of the WORK,
    any transformation of the WORK (for example COMPILATION (MEANING
    1), text processing, non-literal copying), any work which has the
    intended use of producing a MODIFICATION (for example a text produced
    as input to the "patch" program), any work combining or incorporating
    the WORK other than through its PUBLIC INTERFACES, any work which
    creates a new PUBLIC INTERFACE for the work, including through its
    PUBLIC INTERFACES (for example, adding a graphical user interface
    means of using the WORK when the work is a command-line program,
    or adding a web service interface to the work, when the work is a
    command-line program); or a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TRAINED with the
    SOURCE CODE or any transformation of the WORK are all considered to
    be the WORK. For example: a compiled program; a modified program;
    a program, system or device containing the WORK; a program produced
    by connecting another program and the WORK together except through
    a PUBLIC INTERFACE; a version of the WORK translated to a different
    computer language; a version of the texts of the WORK translated to
    another human language;

2.10 COMPILATION has two meanings. COMPILATION (MEANING 1) is the
     creation of an executable form of the WORK from SOURCE
     CODE. COMPILATION generally involves multiple tools, for example
     a compiler, an assembler, and a linker. COMPILATION may include
     the use of conditional compilation facilities provided by the
     developers of the WORK, and configuration of the options of the
     aforementioned tools.

     COMPILATION (MEANING 2) is a "work formed by the collection
     and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,
     coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a
     whole constitutes an original work of authorship." (from Title 17
     of the United States Code, Section 101).

2.11 A PUBLIC INTERFACE is an interface that is part of a fundamental
     purpose of the work to provide services to other works without
     those works becoming MODIFICATIONS, or causing the combination of
     works. For example, the command-line processor in a command-line
     program, the input of a language interpreter which processes the
     intended language, the HTTP interface of a web browser, or the
     system call interface of an operating system kernel. The fundamental
     nature of the interface within the work is important. A developer
     may not unilaterally add a PUBLIC INTERFACE to an existing program
     or remove such an interface without the agreement of the other
     LICENSORS. The simple existence of an API does not automatically
     make that API a PUBLIC INTERFACE. PUBLIC INTERFACES means one or 
     more of a PUBLIC INTERFACE.

     Where it could be unclear, the declaration of a public interface,
     or that a particular interface is not a public interface, may be
     stated in the CONTACT.txt file.

2.12 MODIFICATION is:
a)   Any alteration or transformation of the WORK other than COMPILATION
     (MEANING 1).

b)   The combination or inclusion of the WORK or any portion of it with another
     work other than through a PUBLIC INTERFACE or AGGREGATION, such that
     the two works are combined into a single program or application,
     regardless of the means of such combination or inclusion, whether or
     not such combination or inclusion is considered the creation
     of a derivative work under copyright and moral rights law. For
     example, dynamic linking, or the provision of a program through any
     interface that is integrated into a second program, such that the
     functionality of the first program is added to the combination of
     both programs. AGGREGATION is not MODIFICATION.

c)   Production of a work with the purpose of producing a MODIFICATION,
     even when the modification is done remotely, or at a later date,
     or where there is no attribution indicating a MODIFICATION. For
     example: producing a file to be provided to the "patch" utility to
     cause the production of an altered version of the WORK; producing
     a program that modifies the WORK; TRAINING of a MACHINE LEARNING
     MODEL with the SOURCE CODE or any transformation of the WORK so
     that the MACHINE LEARNING MODEL may later produce any output which
     is influenced by that input.

  d) Production of a SHIM.

2.13 RESTRICTED RIGHTS are any rights regarding the WORK that are protected
     by copyright, patent, or moral rights law; and additionally any
     acts which are specifically restricted by these terms; with this
     exception: you may perform the actions necessary to examine these terms
     and the CONTACT.txt file and provide them to others to examine, however
     you must not take advantage of other files revealed by those actions.

     RESTRICTED RIGHTS include (but are not limited to) ephemeral,
     non-literal, or other copying; reading or examining the WORK
     other than to read these terms and the CONTACT.txt file; use,
     redistribution, modification, performance of the WORK; TRAINING
     of a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL with SOURCE CODE or any transformation
     of the WORK; and exercise of any of the aforestated rights or acts
     upon a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TRAINED thusly.

2.14 PROTECTING JURISDICTIONS are those that provide legal protection of
     RESTRICTED RIGHTS regarding the work, except that they are not
     required to protect patents. Along with all of the usual copyright
     and/or moral rights protections, they must protect the copyright or
     moral rights of works used to used to TRAIN a MACHINE LEARNING
     MODEL. At this writing, (May, 2024) the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION
     asserts that the nation of Japan is not a PROTECTING JURISDICTION
     due to the lack of protection of works used to TRAIN a MACHINE
     LEARNING MODEL.

2.15 The LICENSOR is the legal entity which owns the WORK, and which applies
     these terms to it. LICENSORS means one or more LICENSOR. The use of the
     term LICENSOR is not to be construed that these terms are anything but a
     contract.
     [Most works in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION will be the product of many real
     persons, and businesses, and organizations, who may license it directly
     or through another legal entity.]

2.17 SOURCE CODE is the human-readable, unobfuscated and preferred form of a
     work for modification. In the case of a compiled or interpreted
     computer language, this would be the language used as input to the
     compiler or interpreter.

2.18 PUBLIC RELEASE is the publication of the SOURCE CODE of the WORK or a
     MODIFICATION in a public site on the internet, licensed under these
     terms, where it is expected to be permanently and reliably available
     worldwide for anonymous download without any permission or legal
     agreement in addition to these terms. Because governments do not
     necessarily allow access to all nations, it must be possible for
     another party to anonymously download and redistribute the WORK,
     potentially making it accessable in a nation YOU can not provide
     access to.

     [One example, at this writing, would be a public
     repository on "github.com", although that site has national restrictions,
     see
     https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls .
     The most common practical form of PUBLIC RELEASE at this writing
     is contribution of a modification to a project via the "pull"
     mechanism of a public "git" repository.]

2.19 The POST-OPEN COLLECTION is all works that have been placed under
     these terms by LICENSORS who have entered into the POST-OPEN
     OPERATING AGREEMENT, and for which PUBLIC RELEASE has been performed.

2.20 TERMINATION immediately discontinues YOUR GRANT OF RIGHTS to all works
     in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION, including (but not limited to) the WORK,
     but all other terms continue to apply and YOUR consent to these terms
     survives TERMINATION. TERMINATION is never ended automatically,
     or simply by the cure of the condition causing TERMINATION. YOU
     must take a specific action to cure TERMINATION, such as entering
     into one of the contracts that allows the condition that previously
     caused TERMINATION (the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT or the POST-OPEN
     PAID CONTRACT), or by participating in the POST-OPEN REMEDIATION
     PROCESS. TERMINATES is the act or past-tense of TERMINATION.

     A NON-TERMINATED PARTY is a party to a POST-OPEN PERMISSION 
     or the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT which is not currently subject
     to TERMINATION.

2.21 YEAR is YOUR fiscal year which is accepted by YOUR national tax
     authority and which YOU routinely use for accounting purposes,
     otherwise the first day of January through the last day day of
     December of the Julian calendar in YOUR time zone.

2.22 EXPORT CONTROLLED USE is:
     a) Any use or MODIFICATION of the WORK that could make the WORK
     subject to export control law, for example the USA ITAR and EAR.
     Examples of EXPORT CONTROLLED USE would be use or MODIFICATION
     for military or defense purposes, or to weaponize the WORK.

     We note that both ITAR and EAR have carve-outs for information
     in the public domain (in a trade-secret rather than copyright sense),
     which should include Post-Open software. This is protective of work
     which may be listed as a munition under export control law, but also
     has peaceful use, for example systems for space and satellite use, some
     radio communication systems, low-bandwidth digital voice CODECs.
     We do not mean to prohibit such work in these terms. However, the
     developer must take care to maintain this protection.
 
     b) Offering of or performance of service regarding the WORK to any
     entity for military or defense purposes, or to weaponize the WORK,
     even when the WORK is information in the public domain. [This
     is referred to in USA export control law as provision of defense
     services, and potentially makes the work subject to export control
     laws when it otherwise would not be.]

2.23 CIRCUMVENTION STRATEGIES are legal or technical strategies which may
     have the effect of circumventing these terms. For example: failing to
     disclose to the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION or the LICENSORS a condition
     that would cause TERMINATION; creating one or more legal entities
     for the purpose of entering into these terms while insulating another
     legal entity from these terms; creating a technical means of connecting
     a program in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION to a second program other than
     through a PUBLIC INTERFACE, which may cause that second program to not
     be considered part of the WORK.
     
2.24 DRAFT and FINAL
     A DRAFT version of of this or a related document is released for
     comment and revision. It is not recommended for use as a license
     on a work. A FINAL version is released after editing and approval
     (potentially by a large community) and is intended for use as a
     license on a work.

2.25 SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE is the performance of a work in the POST-OPEN
     COLLECTION for another entity.

2.26 An EMBEDDED SYSTEM is a hardware device containing a work in the
     POST-OPEN COLLECTION.

2.27 A SHIM is an adaptation of a PUBLIC INTERFACE or any other part of the
     WORK to a different interface, which may have the effect of circumventing
     these terms, even if it has another technical purpose. SHIMS is the plural
     of SHIM.

2.28 A POST-OPEN PERMISSION is one of the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST LICENSE, the
     POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT, or the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT, as applicable.

     The POST-OPEN PERMISSIONS are the set of all three of the POST-OPEN
     ZERO-COST LICENSE, the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT, and the POST-OPEN
     PAID LICENSE.

2.29 REVENUE is all money collected and the monetary equivalent of any
     non-monetary value collected, including (but not limited to)
     taxation, donations, grants, bequests, property, barter, a
     non-government currency (for example cryptocurrency), a valuable
     negotiable instrument (for example stock), a legal instrument
     (for example a deed), the grant of rights or privileges.
 
2.30 REMUNERATION is the collection of REVENUE in exchange for something,
     regardless of whether an action is performed directly by YOU or on
     YOUR behalf. This includes (but is not limited to) be payment for a
     service (for example SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE), for rights or privileges
     for example a software license, or property (for example an EMBEDDED
     SYSTEM).

2.32 US-ENGLISH is the dialect of the human language English commonly used in
     legal documents in the United States, with terms defined by the "LexPredict
     Legal Dictionary"
     [currently at https://github.com/LexPredict/lexpredict-legal-dictionary ,
      this dictionary is under Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 license].

     The version of that dictionary to be used is the last version released
     by the LexPredict project before the release of the applicable version of
     these terms by the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION. Where a definition is absent
     in the above reference, or where definitions conflict, the court or
     arbitrator will determine the applicable definition.

2.33 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION is the first step of the RELEASE PROCESS, which
     releases YOU from these terms. The VOLUNTARY TERMINATION DATE is a present
     or future date which you communicate to the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION as the
     date upon which you wish TERMINATION to be effective.

     To be released from these terms, YOU must first go through VOLUNTARY
     TERMINATION even if YOU have already involuntarily become subject to
     TERMINATION.

     To initiate VOLUNTARY TERMINATION, inform the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION
     electronically via this URL [https://postopen.org/voluntary-termination/].

     Voluntary termination announces that you believe you have (or
     will have) ceased exercising RESTRICTED RIGHTS regarding any WORK
     in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION before YOUR VOLUNTARY TERMINATION DATE,
     and removes YOUR GRANT OF RIGHTS, but does not release you from any
     other of the terms of any POST-OPEN PERMISSION. To be released from
     those terms, you must go through the RELEASE PROCESS.

     If you find that YOU have exercised RESTRICTED RIGHTS regarding any WORK
     in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION on or after your VOLUNTARY TERMINATION date,
     that aborts VOLUNTARY TERMINATION. YOU must inform the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION.
     You may then restart VOLUNTARY TERMINATION from that date or later, or elect to
     forego TERMINATION.

2.34 The RELEASE PROCESS is the process for being released from these terms.
     YOU must first go through VOLUNTARY TERMINATION. 365 days after your
     VOLUNTARY TERMINATION DATE, if you have not exercised RESTRICTED RIGHTS
     regarding any WORK in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION for a period of at least
     365 days, you may certify that fact in writing, with an officer's signature,
     to the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION, and request to be released from all POST-OPEN
     PERMISSIONS. If the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION does not grant the release,
     YOU or the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may initiate a dispute as specified in
     these terms.

3. CONDITIONS

3.2 ZERO-COST CONDITIONS

    TERMINATION occurs when any of the conditions in the following list
    apply to YOU and YOU have not already entered into the POST-OPEN
    ZERO-COST CONTRACT. If YOU wish to continue to exercise RESTRICTED
    RIGHTS after one of these conditions applies, YOU may enter into the
    POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT. [Which is a version of these same terms
    with the addition of clear and recorded consent by YOU.]

a)  You exercise RESTRICTED RIGHTS outside of a PROTECTING JURISDICTION.
    [To avoid this term, businesses may wish to pre-emptively enter into
     the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT. This has no difference in terms from
     the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST LICENSE other than explicit consent and a
     representation that the party signing has the right to enter into a
     contract on behalf of the entity signed for.]

3.3 PAID CONDITIONS

    TERMINATION occurs when any of the conditions in the following list
    apply to YOU. If YOU wish to continue to exercise RESTRICTED RIGHTS,
    YOU may enter into the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT. [Which is a separate
    agreement that gives permission to perform the stated actions, in
    exchange for annual payment and an annual disclosure requirement.]

a)  The REVENUE through all legal entities defined as YOU exceeds
    a value equivalent to USD$5 Million per YEAR.

    [This is intended to prevent free-riding by government and non-profits.
    Governments levy many odious procedures upon us and we must pay
    for these and some of our technical support of them, as well as
    maintain an involvement with them and their law-creation processes,
    for our own protection. Large non-profits also require some technical
    support which we may not be able to bill for, and are not universally
    purely virtuous in purpose: for example many have highly-compensated
    officers, we omit other examples to avoid argument.]

    [We do not ask for a portion of profit because it is so easy to hide
    profit - it is a cliche in the feature film business that if you
    have a profit, you are doing your books wrong.]

b)  You perform SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE.
   
c)  You provide an EMBEDDED SYSTEM to others for REMUNERATION.

d)  You provide a WORK in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION to others for REMUNERATION.

e)  You make MODIFICATIONS to any WORK in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION without
    first performing one of these actions (you may perform both):

    I)  You enter into the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT and make a PUBLIC
        RELEASE of the MODIFICATION.

    II) You enter into the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT.

3.4 TERMINATION CONDITIONS

TERMINATION occurs if any of the conditions in the following list apply to you.

a)  You perform any action prohibited by these terms, breach this contract,
    or infringe RESTRICTED RIGHTS of any work in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION.

b)  You bring suit or other enforcement for patent infringement regarding any
    work in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION or cause, fund or join such a suit
    or enforcement.

c)  YOU further restrict the rights granted in these terms, YOU add any terms
    to these terms, or YOU make separate terms which change the effect
    of these terms. For example, you enter into a contract with users which
    includes a punitive action if they redistribute security information
    regarding a work in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION or MODIFICATIONS of such a
    work intended to cure or mitigate a security issue.

d)  You offer or perform EXPORT CONTROLLED USE regarding any work in the
    POST-OPEN COLLECTION.

e)  YOU deliberately do not report security-related information regarding any
    work in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION to the LICENSORS and the POST-OPEN
    ADMINISTRATION as soon as possible, or YOU create an agreement with terms
    restricting any other party from making such a report, except in the case
    that you are legally restricted from making such a disclosure by a direct
    order of your government (rather than a private agreement such as an NDA),
    and then only as long as such a restriction prevents you from making the
    report. [Please see https://postopen.org/security/ to make a report to the
    POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION and the LICENSOR.]

    For example, if YOU are a company or other entity that provides security
    services, and you disclose security information about the WORK to your
    customers and affiliates without also disclosing it to the POST-OPEN
    ADMINISTRATION and the LICENSORS before then or at the same time, you
    violate these terms and TERMINATION occurs.

f)  You train a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL with the SOURCE CODE or any transformation
    of a work within the POST-OPEN COLLECTION, or exercise any rights protected
    by copyright, patent, or moral rights law regarding a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
    TRAINED with the text of a work within the POST-OPEN COLLECTION, except if
    YOU join the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT, place the resulting work under
    these terms, and YOU make a PUBLIC RELEASE of the resulting work.

g)  YOU are unresponsive for more than 60 days to enforcement-related
    communications of the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION regarding any work in the
    POST-OPEN COLLECTION, a POST-OPEN PERMISSION, or the POST-OPEN OPERATING
    AGREEMENT.

h)  YOU provide the WORK to others for the purpose of insulating them from
    these terms.

i)  YOU go through the VOLUNTARILY TERMINATION process.

4. TERMS

   These terms include this entire document, including (but not limited to) the
   DEFINITIONS, CONDITIONS, and PRELUDE, except for the ADVISORY SECTIONS and
   WORKING NOTES.

4.1 GOVERNING VERSION AND EXTERNAL DEFINITIONS

    While the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may release official translations,
    the US-ENGLISH version of this license provided by the POST-OPEN
    ADMINISTRATION is the definitive version. In any dispute over the meaning
    of these terms, the court or arbitrator must interpret the US-ENGLISH
    version, and its terms govern.

    Where a term is not defined within these terms, an external definition of
    that term from a source defined in the definition US-ENGLISH, for the
    US-ENGLISH version of this license, will govern.

4.2 REQUIREMENT TO LICENSE

    No exercise of RESTRICTED RIGHTS, including (but not restricted
    to) ephemeral copying or non-literal copying, is permitted except
    by entering into a POST-OPEN PERMISSION.

    You must enter into a POST-OPEN PERMISSION if another legal entity
    exercises RESTRICTED RIGHTS on YOUR behalf, for example SOFTWARE AS
    A SERVICE.

4.3 NO WARRANTY, REQUIREMENT FOR INDEMNIFICATION

    To the extent permissible by law, no warranties are applicable to the
    WORK, even warranties of usability or fitness for use.

    You agree to indemnify the LICENSORS and the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION
    regarding any hazard or liability caused by YOUR use of the WORK,
    including (but not limited to) damages to you and others, penalties
    or fines levied by government, and prosecution of patent infringement
    resulting from YOUR exercise of RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If such liability
    is of concern to YOU, you are advised to purchase insurance to
    protect YOU from it. [The POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION does not offer
    such insurance at this time.]

4.5 ASSERTION OF PRESENCE OF DEFECTS, NO RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT OR CURE

    There are defects in the WORK, both known and unknown, including
    (but not limited to) ones with a potential effect upon security or
    privacy of the user, and ones that could conceivably cause damage to
    life or property. It is not technically or economically possible to
    produce a work free of defects within the state of the art at this
    time.

    The deliberate insertion of defects is possible, including
    deliberate circumventions of security or insertion of a surveillance
    mechanism. The LICENSORS and the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may operate
    systems to defend against such insertions, but is not technically or
    economically possible to guard against them with 100% reliability,
    especially in the case of nation-state actors. It is also possible
    that a developer, the LICENSORS or the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION
    could be faced with government requirements that have the effect of
    circumventing security or allowing surveillance, and which they would
    not be allowed to disclose.

    The LICENSORS and the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION decline any
    responsibility to report, repair, or cure defects, to the extent
    permissible by law, even though they may operate a defect reporting
    system and software updates which routinely report and cure defects.
    Additional services to report and cure defects may be available through
    a paid support contract.

4.6 ASSERTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF PATENT CLAIMS

    The WORK may be considered to come under one or more existing patent
    claims, regardless of the validity or enforceability of such claims. A
    complete patent search and the development of an understanding of
    what patents are actually valid or enforceable is not technically or
    economically possible. The liability for such claims is entirely
    YOURS, the LICENSORS and the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION deny any
    such liability, including to YOU. If such liability is of concern to
    YOU, YOU are advised to purchase insurance to protect you from it.

4.7 MODIFICATION

    MODIFICATION of the WORK with PUBLIC RELEASE requires entry into the
    POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT. If YOU wish to make MODIFICATIONS
    without PUBLIC RELEASE, YOU must enter into the POST-OPEN PAID
    CONTRACT. You may enter into both and make modifications under each
    as appropriate. If YOU perform MODIFICATION without entering into
    the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT or the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT,
    TERMINATION occurs.

    [Producers of significant MODIFICATIONS and new works are advised that
    if YOU make PUBLIC RELEASE and enter into the POST-OPEN OPERATING
    AGREEMENT, the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may pay you with part of the
    revenue collected under the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT. Thus, there is
    a financial incentive for all parties to publish their modifications
    and increase the size and functionality of the POST-OPEN COLLECTION.

    Modifications that are made available via PUBLIC RELEASE are more
    likely to be maintained as part of the overall project, while private
    modifications must be brought up to sync with every public release
    if you wish to use the features and bug fixes in that release,
    and this will be a continuing expense.]

4.8 CONSENT AND AGREEMENT

    This is a contract between YOU, the LICENSOR, and the POST-OPEN
    ADMINISTRATION. Exercise of any RESTRICTED RIGHTS indicates YOUR
    consent to these terms. YOU may explicitly indicate your consent
    by entering into the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT, but your consent
    is indicated whether or not you do so.

    If YOU are a government, nation, or sovereign power, you agree
    to comply with the law and these terms as they would apply to an
    ordinary real person (not one with special rights such as royalty
    or a diplomat) who lives within a normal region of your jurisdiction:
    for example a state, province, or canton where your laws apply, not
    a special region where your laws are overriden (for example a Tribal
    Sovereignty in the United States if party "a" in the definition of YOU
    is not the Tribal Sovereignty). You specifically consent to allow and
    commit to respond to any lawsuit and arbitration by the LICENSORS or the
    POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION.

    If YOU are more than one legal entity, each individual entity which
    exercises RESTRICTED RIGHTS must enter into these terms, the POST-OPEN
    ZERO-COST LICENSE, or the POST-OPEN PAID LICENSE.

    YOU agree to comply with these terms regardless of the status of the
    WORK under copyright, moral rights, or patent law. Where the law
    grants YOU a right and these terms prohibit it, these terms will
    prevail to the extent permitted by law. YOU agree not to exercise
    RESTRICTED RIGHTS outside of these terms. You agree not to TRAIN a
    MACHINE LEARNING MODEL with the information of any work in the
    POST-OPEN COLLECTION, or perform ephemeral copying with the purpose
    of TRAINING such a model, unless YOU join the POST-OPEN OPERATING
    AGREEMENT, place the resulting work under these terms, and YOU make a
    PUBLIC RELEASE of it.

4.9 NO RIGHT TO SUBLICENSE

    This agreement directly is between the LICENSOR, the POST-OPEN
    ADMINISTRATION, and YOU.  You may not sublicense the WORK.

    When you convey a copy of the WORK to another party, or run any WORK
    in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION as SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE for another party,
    you must give them a copy of these terms and inform them that to legally
    use the work or have it performed for them, they would be required to
    either enter into these terms or the POST-OPEN PAID LICENSE, depending on
    their situation.
    [It is a intended that these terms can require payment from both
     the softwar-as-a-service provider and their customer.]

4.10 PUBLIC INTERFACES

    YOU agree to connect the WORK to software which is not under these terms
    only through its PUBLIC INTERFACES. YOU agree that an API present in the
    WORK which is not a PUBLIC INTERFACE is not permissible for use for
    connecting to programs that are not under these terms. If you produce a
    SHIM, you agree to provide it only to parties that are party to a
    POST-OPEN PERMISSION.

4.12 USE OF TERMS AND MISREPRESENTATION

    YOU agree not to apply these terms to any work, even by reference, without
    first becoming a party to the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT. YOU agree not
    to use the text of a POST-OPEN PERMISSION except in the form of an agreement
    properly executed by a party and the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION or an
    agreement not executed by any party and provided for information purposes
    only.

    YOU agree not to represent a work as Post-Open unless it is issued by a
    NON-TERMINATED PARTY to the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT and is available
    via the POST-OPEN PERMISSIONS.

    YOU agree not to represent the POST-OPEN ZERO-COST LICENSE, the
    POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT, or the POST-OPEN PAID LICENSE as an
    Open Source license. However, software may be dual-licensed as Open
    Source and Post-Open, and only in that case YOU may represent that
    the software is available under Open Source terms. You agree not to
    otherwise represent software under these terms as Open Source.

4.13 NO CIRCUMVENTION

    YOU agree not to employ CIRCUMVENTION STRATEGIES for the purpose of
    circumventing these terms. Where such strategies are employed for a
    purpose other than circumventing these terms, YOU agree that in any
    dispute, any possible circumvention of these terms or applicable law
    caused by such strategies will be interpreted as if the circumvention
    does not exist.

    In particular, see the definition of YOU and the terms regarding PUBLIC
    INTERFACES.

4.14 GRANT OF RIGHTS

    In consideratienton of your consent to the entirety of these terms:
    as long as TERMINATION has not occurred, you are granted the right
    to exercise RESTRICTED RIGHTS other than MODIFICATION and TRAINING
    of a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL, including (but not restricted to) use
    and redistribution of the WORK and exercise of patent claims of the
    LICENSORS and the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION to the extent necessary to
    exercise the aforementioned RESTRICTED RIGHTS under these terms.

4.15 CONDITIONS FOR TERMINATION

    You agree not to perform any of the actions listed as conditions for
    termination under the sections on PAID CONDITIONS or ZERO-COST CONDITIONS
    without first entering into the contract that would provide permission to
    perform those actions and performing any required actions of that contract
    (for example, entering into the POST-OPEN OPERATING AGREEMENT and
    performing PUBLIC RELEASE of a MODIFICATION, or entering into the
    POST-OPEN ZERO-COST CONTRACT or the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT).

    You agree not to perform any of the actions listed as conditions for
    termination under the section on TERMINATION CONDITIONS.

    You agree to perform the POST-OPEN REMEDIATION PROCESS if you infringe,
    with or without intention or foreknowledge, upon the copyright or moral
    rights of any work in the POST-OPEN COLLECTION or violate these terms in
    any way.

4.16 SEVERABILITY

    If a court should strike any of these terms or find them unenforceable, the
    minimum possible text is struck and the remainder of these terms survive.

4.17 FORCE MAJEURE

    A Party affected by Force Majeure will not assume any liability
    under these terms. However, subject to the Party affected by
    Force Majeure having taken its reasonable and practicable efforts
    to perform these terms, the Party claiming for exemption of the
    liabilities may only be exempted from performing such liability as
    within limitation of the part performance delayed or prevented by
    Force Majeure. Once causes for such exemption of liabilities are
    rectified and remedied, all parties agree to resume performance of
    these terms with their best efforts.

4.18 ACCEPTANCE OF THE POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION AS A PARTY TO ANY DISPUTE

     YOU agree that the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION has the right to represent
     the LICENSORS in any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to 
     these terms.

4.19 ARBITRATION

     Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these terms,
     or the breach thereof, will be settled by arbitration administered
     by the American Arbitration Association if the parties are all within
     the United States, or the International Centre for Dispute Resolution
     in the case that a party to the dispute is external to the United
     States, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and/or
     other appropriate rules of those organizations. Judgment on the award
     rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
     jurisdiction thereof. YOU and all parties to these terms consent
     to the use of computer videoconferencing or telephone conferencing,
     as an alternative to personal appearance, for the operation of
     arbitration and any court session.

4.22 SEAL
     A party to a dispute concerning these terms or the breach thereof may
     obtain filing under seal of information that would otherwise be restricted
     under these terms:
     a) By consent of the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION for itself and as
        representative of any LICENSORS and the other party to the
        dispute, where that is allowed. [California requires a court order to
        file a record under seal.]
     b) By order of the court or arbitrator under the rules prevailing upon
        that adjudication.

4.23 TRANSLATIONS
     The POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may provide translations of this license into
     other languages (human languages; and computational legal languages, for
     example "smart contracts", if any such thing is ever capable of representing
     these terms). Translations without the permission of the POST-OPEN
     ADMINISTRATION are prohibited, but this is not meant to discourage
     translations, contact us if you would like to make one.

4.24 REVISION OF THESE TERMS

     During the present DRAFT terms period, changes to these terms published as
     a revised DRAFT by the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION are effective immediately and
     supersede the terms previously issued.

     After the first publication of a FINAL version of these terms, the following
     terms apply:

     The POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION may publish revised versions of these terms.
     Revised terms will remain substantially similar to these ones, and may
     include changes only to:
 
     a) Correct errors and ambiguities.
     b) Avoid loopholes that have come into use.
     c) Respond to findings of courts which sever some of the terms or interpret
        some of the terms unfavorably.
     d) Respond to new law or law newly enforced upon any party to these terms.
     e) Respond to changes in technology (for example this text responds to
        the rise of MACHINE LEARNING MODELS and TRAINING of such, terms which
        were not included in classical Open Source licenses). 
     f) Respond to changes in monetary value: for example a change in the
        real value of the stated amount of REVENUE requiring that YOU
        join into the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT, or a change in the nation or
        other entity for which the value is defined, for example a change
        from USD to a presently-theoretical stable global currency.

     In the case of a change to the amount of REVENUE which mandates
     use of the POST-OPEN PAID CONTRACT, that amount may only be adjusted using
     commonly-accepted inflationary (and deflationary) indices to an equivalent
     value at the current time.
    
     When changes to these terms are published as FINAL revised terms
     by the POST-OPEN ADMINISTRATION (rather than a DRAFT), YOU may, at
     your discretion, apply the new terms, or you may continue to apply
     these terms to works already in your use for no more than one year
     from the publication of the revised terms, and then you must apply
     the new terms. If you begin to use another work in the collection,
     the new terms apply to it immediately. [This allows YOU time for
     legal evaluation of the new terms and to make decisions regarding
     YOUR use of the POST-OPEN COLLECTION.]
